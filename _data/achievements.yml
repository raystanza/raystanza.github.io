    AI APIs.

    retro-styled, and CRT-themed. It uses YAML data files, GitHub Actions for deployment,
    and includes thoughtful UX touches like animated greetings and responsive layouts.
- title: DevOps & Bash Automation
  description: Over the years I've built up a huge set of Bash aliases and helper
    functions to speed up my work - from Laravel and Git to SSH and system tasks.
    I also run cron jobs for DNS updates and backups, keeping everything tidy and
    automated.
- title: Minecraft Server Hosting & Monitoring
  description: I run a Fabric-based Minecraft server on an old Dell R720xd. It's tuned

    to use.
- title: Inertia.js Deep Integration
  description: I've gone deep with Inertia.js - handling transitions, form validation,
    queue job polling, and more. I love how it keeps things reactive without building
    a full SPA.
- title: Bash Toolkit for Laravel Developers
  description: I created a Laravel-focused Bash toolkit to speed up things like running
    Artisan commands, resetting databases, and managing queues. It's part of my everyday
    workflow now.
- title: Advanced Git Workflows
  description: I use Git tags, hooks, and branches to stay organized. I wrote a script
    called `generate_changelog.sh` that creates structured changelogs based on version
    tags.

  description: I used MkDocs (with the Material theme) to document internal projects
    like Whiskers and Wheels. Complete with setup guides, styling references, and
    deployment steps all in one place.
- title: Home Lab & Local Networking
  description: My homelab is made up of Ubuntu servers running apps, games, and tools
    for my family and my projects. I manage local DNS, IP assignments, and routing
    myself. It's my playground and my proving ground.

  description: I've built fully reactive forms in Vue 3 tied into Laravel's form requests.
    They support real-time validation and error handling without the complexity of
    a full SPA.

  description: I set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy my Jekyll
    site when I push to `master`. It includes steps for building, checking, and publishing
    - no manual work needed.
- title: Self-Taught Journey
  description: I've been in IT for over 25 years, and I've taught myself full-stack
    web development while working full time and raising two teenage boys. I do this
    because I love it - and I believe in always learning, building, and improving.
- title: OxideMiner - Rust RandomX CPU Miner
