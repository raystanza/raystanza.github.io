## Purpose

My kids wanted to randomly generate emoji's and have those descriptions read aloud.

[ClickeR 'Game'](https://chundersnatch.com/)

---

## Clicker 'Game'

A 'Game' wherein you click a button, generating a series of random emjoi's (and their descriptions as a paragraph).

The 'Player' can choose to have the browser speak the paragraph aloud, using a selected voice.

This is fairly useless and is intented as an annoyance machine written in MD/HTML/CSS/JS.

## Game Legend

| UI item | description |
| ---: | :--- |
| 🔊 | Choose voice, change pitch & rate |
| 😃 | Show Emoji 'paragraph' |
| ✏️ | Show text 'paragraph' |
| 💾 | Save Emoji Image |
| ⏯ | Speak the text (in ✏️) using the selected voice (in 🔊) |
| ⏹ | Stops the voice currently speaking |
| Pitch | Tune the pitch up or down (🐿 🆚 😈). |
| Rate | The speed at which the selected voice will speak the text. |

### FAQ

- Q: Can I change the speed/pitch?
- A: Yes! Click on the 🔊 icon and you will find both!

- Q: Why is the selected voice not working?
- A: You probably don't have that localized language pack installed in the browser. To fix this, change your system language. (<-- not responsible for your broken OS)

- Q: What do I win if I get the highest score?
- A: The satisfaction of knowing you created the largest nonsensical collection of partial & run-on sentences by clicking a button.
