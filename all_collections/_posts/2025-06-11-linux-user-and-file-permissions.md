## 1. Introduction

File‑system permissions are the bouncers of your Debian system—deciding who gets past the velvet rope and who’s left outside clutching their `Permission denied` errors. Whether you are hardening a production server or simply configuring your personal laptop, understanding **user, group, and other** permissions is crucial. This article serves both as a **step‑by‑step tutorial** and a **quick‑reference manual** for everyday use.

## 2. The User–Group–Other Model

Every file or directory in Debian (and POSIX systems in general) is associated with three classes of entities:

| Class | Shorthand | Typical Audience                |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| User  | `u`       | The file owner (you, hopefully) |
| Group | `g`       | A team the owner belongs to     |
| Other | `o`       | Everyone else                   |

A *fourth* class — **`a`** for *all* — is simply a macro that means “`u`, `g`, **and** `o`.”

---

## 3. Octal (Numeric) Permissions

Unix permissions map neatly to a three‑digit octal number, commonly called the **“chmod 755 style.”** Each digit is a sum of bits:

| Permission  | Binary | Octal | Meaning      |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | ------------ |
| read (`r`)  | 100    | 4     | View content |
| write (`w`) | 010    | 2     | Modify       |
| exec (`x`)  | 001    | 1     | Run/enter    |

Combine the bits per class:

```text
7 = 4 + 2 + 1 → rwx   # full control
5 = 4 + 0 + 1 → r-x   # read & execute
6 = 4 + 2 + 0 → rw-   # read & write
4 = 4 + 0 + 0 → r--   # read‑only
0 = 0 + 0 + 0 → ---   # no permissions
```

**Common recipes**:

| Mode | Who can do what                    | Recommended use                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 755  | Owner: `rwx`; Group & Other: `r-x` | Public executables & web roots |
| 700  | Owner only: `rwx`                  | Private scripts & SSH keys     |
| 644  | Owner: `rw-`; Group & Other: `r--` | Config files & HTML pages      |
| 775  | Owner & Group: `rwx`; Other: `r-x` | Shared project directories     |

---

## 4. Symbolic (Text) Permissions & the `ls -l` Output

When you run `ls -l`, you get something like:

```text
drwxrwxr-x 21 user1 user1 4096 Apr 26 16:15 projects/
-rw-rw-r--  1 user1 user1  472 Nov  9  2024 403.html
```

Let’s decode `drwxrwxr-x`:

1. **File type (char 1)**

   * `-` regular file
   * **`d` directory**
   * `l` symlink, `c` character device, etc.
2. **Permission triads (chars 2‑10)**

   * `rwx`  — *user* (`u`)
   * `rwx`  — *group* (`g`)
   * `r-x`  — *other* (`o`)
3. **Links (21)** – number of hard links or sub‑dirs
4. **Owner (user1)** – user account name/UID
5. **Group (user1)** – primary group/GID
6. **Size (4096)** – bytes (note: directories often show 4096 because of ext4 block size)
7. **Date/Time (Apr 26 16:15)** – last modification
8. **Name (projects/)** – with trailing slash for directories

### Special Bits in Symbolic Form

| Bit    | Symbolic           | Octal | Effect                                      |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| setuid | `s` in user triad  | 4000  | Executes with owner UID                     |
| setgid | `s` in group triad | 2000  | Executes with group GID; dirs inherit group |
| sticky | `t` in other triad | 1000  | Only owner/root may delete (e.g., `/tmp`)   |

Example: `rwsr-xr-x` → *setuid executable* (`chmod 4755 mybin`).

## 5. The `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` Power Trio

| Command | Purpose                                  | Quick Example                             |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `chmod` | Change permission bits                   | `chmod 755 /var/www`                      |
| `chown` | Change ownership (user + optional group) | `sudo chown www-data:www-data index.html` |
| `chgrp` | Change group only                        | `sudo chgrp developers project.log`       |

**Symbolic flags** with `chmod`:

```shell
chmod u=rw,g=r,o= filename     # explicit
chmod g+w,o-rwx my.conf        # additive/subtractive
chmod a+X scripts/ -R          # capital X adds exec only where already executable or directory
```

---

## 6. Default Permissions & `umask`

When you create a new file or directory, the kernel starts from a base of `666` (files) or `777` (dirs) and then **subtracts** the `umask` (default 022 on Debian).

```shell
$ umask          # show current mask
0022             # leading 0 ⇒ octal, not decimal
```

Resulting defaults:

| Resource  | Calculation       | Final Mode |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| File      | `666 – 022 = 644` | rw‑r‑r--   |
| Directory | `777 – 022 = 755` | rwxr‑xr‑x  |

To make collaborative group directories:

```shell
# Drop the sticky '2' so group gets write
umask 0002
```

Add `umask 0002` to `/etc/profile` or your shell RC for permanence.

## 7. Groups on Debian: The Social Network

Debian follows standard GNU/Linux group handling but adds a few distro‑specific niceties:

1. **Per‑User Private Groups (PUPG):** By default, `adduser` creates a group with the same name as the user and makes it the user’s *primary group*. This allows collaborative sharing via group bits without handing out world write access.

2. **Primary vs Secondary Groups:**

   * **Primary** (GID in `/etc/passwd`) becomes the default owning group of new files.
   * **Secondary** groups live in `/etc/group` and are additive.

3. **Management Commands:**

   | Task                               | Command                          |
   | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | Create a group                     | `sudo addgroup devteam`          |
   | Add user to group                  | `sudo usermod -aG devteam alice` |
   | List groups for user               | `groups alice` or `id alice`     |
   | Switch primary group (new session) | `newgrp devteam`                 |

4. **Shared Directories with SGID:**

```shell
sudo mkdir /srv/project
sudo chown :devteam /srv/project
sudo chmod 2775 /srv/project     # 2 = setgid bit
```

All new files will inherit `devteam` as their group.

## 8. Beyond POSIX: ACLs & Extended Attributes (Optional Advanced Topic)

When simple bits aren’t enough (think web‑apps where multiple roles overlap), Debian’s `acl` package comes to the rescue:

```shell
sudo apt install acl
setfacl -m u:alice:rw setfacl -m g:auditors:r finance.xlsx
getfacl finance.xlsx
```

ACLs coexist with regular permissions; the kernel checks them **after** the classic model.

## 9. Practical Scenarios

### 9.1 Secure a Private SSH Key

```shell
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 9.2 Serve Static Web Content

```shell
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +
sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +
```

### 9.3 Collaborative Git Repo

```shell
sudo addgroup gitshare
sudo usermod -aG gitshare alice bob charlie
sudo chgrp -R gitshare /srv/git/myrepo.git
sudo chmod -R g+ws /srv/git/myrepo.git       # sgid on dirs, group write on files
```

## 10. Troubleshooting Checklist

1. **Check Effective IDs:** `id -u` & `id -G`
2. **Verify Path Components:** Every directory on the path needs execute (`x`) for traversal.
3. **Mind the Mount Options:** `noexec`, `nosuid`, or `nodev` flags can override permissions.
4. **Investigate ACLs:** `getfacl file` if permissions *look* fine but access still fails.

## 11. Quick‑Reference Cheat Sheet

| Task                          | Command                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Change file perms recursively | `chmod -R 755 /path`         |
| Make a file immutable (ext4)  | `chattr +i filename`         |
| See default perms (`umask`)   | `umask`                      |
| Find world‑writable files     | `find / -perm -0002 -type f` |
