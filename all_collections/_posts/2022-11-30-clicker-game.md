My kids wanted to randomly generate emoji's and have those descriptions read aloud.

<a href="https://chundersnatch.com/" rel="noopener">ClickeR 'Game'</a>

#### Game Legend:

| icon | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔊 | Choose voice |
| 😃 | Show Emoji 'paragraph' |
| ✏️ | Show controls & text 'paragraph' |

Clicking the "Say This" button will speak the emoji 'paragraph'.

#### FAQ:
 - Q: Can I change the rate / pitch?
 - A: Yes! Click on the ✏️ icon and you will find both!

 - Q: Why is the selected voice not working?
 - A: You probably don't have that localized language pack installed in the browser.
 
 - Q: What do I win if I get the highest score?
 - A: The satisfaction of knowing you created the largest nonsensical collection of partial & run-on sentences by clicking a button.

### Roadmap
[ ] New UI (Node-less React/Vue/Angular)

[ ] Type in-> Emoji, output->PlainText

[ ] Output Emoji List as SVG/PDF downloadable
