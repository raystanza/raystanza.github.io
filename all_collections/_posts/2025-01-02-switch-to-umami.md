If you’ve ever run a website—or ten—you’ve probably used Google Analytics. It’s the 800-pound gorilla of web analytics, and for a while, I used it too. Back then, it felt like the logical choice: it’s free, powerful, and gives you more data than you know what to do with.

Hosting my analytics with Google felt like letting the fox guard the henhouse—except in this case, the fox is wearing a suit and selling ads for chicken nuggets.

But over time, something about it started to bug me. Maybe it was the data sharing. Maybe it was all those privacy policies getting longer every year. Or maybe it was that uneasy feeling that comes when you realize, *Oh, wait. My visitors’ data is just another cog in Google’s machine.*

So, a couple of months ago, I started looking for an alternative. That’s when I found **Umami Analytics**, and let me tell you—it’s been a game-changer. If you’re managing a handful of websites (like me) and care about things like privacy, speed, and owning your data, you’ll want to stick around. Let’s talk about why I made the switch—and why you might want to consider it, too.

### Why Google Analytics Felt Like the Wrong Fit

Don’t get me wrong: Google Analytics is impressive. It gives you detailed insights about your audience, shows you what’s working (and what isn’t), and integrates with just about everything. But here’s the thing: you’re not the only one looking at that data. Google gets a copy, and they’re not exactly shy about using it.

For someone like me—a privacy-focused admin who runs hobby sites, mostly using LAMP and LIVT stacks—that didn’t sit right. My websites aren’t anything fancy. But even with these low-key sites, I didn’t love the idea of handing my visitors’ data over to a third party.

Privacy matters. And no, I’m not trying to wear a tinfoil hat here—it’s just about creating a space where visitors can browse without feeling like they’re being followed.

### Enter Umami: Analytics Without the Baggage

Umami isn’t as well-known as Google Analytics, and that’s fine. It doesn’t need to be. What it *does* need to be—and what it is—is simple, privacy-respecting, and self-hosted. In other words, it’s exactly what I was looking for.

#### **1. Privacy First, Always**

Umami doesn’t track personal information. It doesn’t use cookies. It doesn’t follow your visitors across the internet. All it does is give you the essentials: page views, referrers, devices, and geography. That’s it. And honestly? That’s all I need.

If Google Analytics feels like inviting Big Brother into your website, Umami feels more like a friendly neighbor who stops by to say, “Hey, looks like you’re getting more visitors today—nice work!”

#### **2. Self-Hosting for Maximum Control**

One of my favorite things about Umami is that you can host it yourself. Since I’m already running everything on Linode, spinning up a new VPS to handle analytics wasn’t a big deal. Setup was straightforward (thanks to the excellent documentation), and now I know exactly where my data is stored—on a server I control. No middlemen, no surprises.

#### **3. Lightweight and Fast**

Have you ever checked the size of the Google Analytics JavaScript file? It’s not exactly small. That means every visitor to your site has to download that script, which can slow things down. Umami, on the other hand, is so lightweight you barely notice it. My page load times improved, and let’s face it: every millisecond counts when you’re trying to keep visitors on your site.

#### **4. Built for Compliance**

If you’ve ever tried to untangle GDPR, CCPA, or any of the other data privacy regulations out there, you know how complicated it can get. With Umami, you don’t have to worry. No cookies. No personal data. No stress.

### Okay, But What’s the Catch?

Let’s be real: Umami isn’t perfect. If you’re running a massive e-commerce site or need advanced features like conversion tracking, multi-channel funnels, or AI-driven insights, you might find Umami a bit too basic. It’s not trying to be Google Analytics, and that’s kind of the point.

For someone like me, though—a guy managing a few hobby sites—it’s exactly what I need. I don’t need fancy graphs or predictive analytics. I need fast, reliable insights that don’t compromise my visitors’ trust. And that’s what Umami delivers.

### Why Umami Just Makes Sense

Switching from Google Analytics to Umami felt a bit like downsizing. At first, I worried I’d miss all the bells and whistles, but now I can’t imagine going back. Umami is simple, private, and fast—and it aligns with my values as a website admin.

If you’re running a website (or several) and care about things like speed, simplicity, and respecting your visitors’ privacy, I’d highly recommend giving Umami a shot. Sure, it’s not as feature-packed as Google Analytics, but it does the job without any of the creepy tracking.

And honestly? It feels good to root for the underdog. Especially when that underdog respects your visitors and keeps the web a little more human.
