## Preface

This article intends to focus on the source of funding for the 'No-Kings' (2025) protests and should not in anyway be seen as a endorsement or condemnation of any side of the argument.

## Introduction

The 'No Kings' protests represent a pivotal chapter in contemporary American political activism, embodying a widespread resistance to what participants view as an erosion of democratic norms under President Donald Trump's administration. Rooted in the foundational American ethos that rejects monarchical rule, the slogan "No Kings" serves as a powerful metaphor for opposing unchecked executive authority, echoing the revolutionary spirit of the nation's founding fathers who declared independence from kingly tyranny. These protests did not emerge in isolation but built upon a series of escalating events beginning in April 2025, when initial smaller gatherings in key cities like Washington, D.C., New York, and Los Angeles drew attention to specific policy grievances, such as immigration reforms and environmental deregulations. By June 14, 2025, the movement had gained significant momentum, attracting an estimated 5 million participants across the country in coordinated rallies that highlighted themes of unity and nonviolent dissent.

The crescendo of activity culminated in the massive October 18, 2025, demonstrations, which saw nearly 7 million attendees converging in over 2,700 locations spanning all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and even extending to international solidarity events. This scale underscored the movement's broad appeal, transcending urban centers to include rural areas and suburban communities. Interspersed were thematic events like the "Free America Weekend" on July 4, 2025, which leveraged Independence Day symbolism to emphasize liberty and self-governance, and the "Good Trouble Lives On" protest on July 17, 2025, paying homage to civil rights icon John Lewis while advocating for ongoing activism. These gatherings were meticulously planned to coincide with significant national moments, such as government shutdowns that affected federal workers and grandiose military parades that critics argued glorified authoritarian tendencies. Protesters, diverse in age, ethnicity, and background, brandished signs proclaiming "Democracy not Monarchy," "Resist the Crown," and the pointed "No One Paid Me to Be Here," directly rebutting claims from detractors that the crowds were artificially assembled through financial incentives.

At their core, the protests emphasized principles of nonviolence, drawing inspiration from historical movements like the Civil Rights era and more recent ones such as the Women's March. Organizers provided extensive training in de-escalation techniques, ensuring that interactions with law enforcement remained peaceful despite occasional tensions. The demonstrations served not only as outlets for public outrage but also as platforms for education, with speakers addressing issues ranging from judicial independence to voting rights. In cities like Miami, cultural elements such as music and dance infused the events with local flavor, fostering a sense of community and resilience. However, beneath this veneer of spontaneity lies a sophisticated organizational framework, as revealed through in-depth analysis of public records, media reports, and social media discussions.

While organizers consistently frame the 'No Kings' protests as authentic grassroots uprisings fueled by genuine public discontent over perceived threats to democracy, a closer examination uncovers a highly coordinated operation supported by more than 200 national organizations and countless local affiliates. This infrastructure enabled rapid mobilization, from digital campaigns that amassed millions of online supporters to on-the-ground logistics that facilitated transportation and safety measures for participants. Funding for these efforts stems from a complex web of progressive foundations, labor unions, and opaque dark-money groups, with aggregate investments surpassing a quarter of a billion dollars based on various investigative analyses. Such financial backing has drawn sharp criticism from Republican figures, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has decried the events as "hate America rallies," and President Trump himself, who has publicly accused "radical left lunatics" of orchestrating paid disruptions. Calls for probes under statutes like the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act have intensified, with allegations that these funds support activities bordering on unrest or insurrection. This report synthesizes insights from diverse sources, including web-based journalism, official organizational statements, and X (formerly Twitter) posts from influencers and analysts, to illuminate the key players, financial conduits, and interconnections, all while prioritizing specificity in names, figures, and linkages for utmost clarity and accountability.

## Key Organizing Groups and Coalitions

The orchestration of the 'No Kings' protests involved a vast coalition of entities from progressive advocacy, labor, civil rights, and issue-specific sectors, forming what has been dubbed the "No Kings alliance." This network encompasses over 200 partners, each contributing to facets like strategic planning, volunteer recruitment, nonviolent training programs, and the establishment of rapid-response mechanisms for sustained activities such as recurring weekly vigils, economic boycotts, and targeted strikes. The alliance's strength lies in its ability to leverage diverse expertise, creating a synergistic effort that amplified the movement's reach and impact. For instance, digital tools for real-time coordination allowed for adaptive responses to unfolding political events, while legal teams prepared for potential confrontations with authorities. To provide a structured understanding, the following sections categorize the major groups, delving into their historical contexts, specific contributions, and interrelations within the broader ecosystem.

### Progressive Advocacy and Grassroots Networks

Central to the protests' success were progressive advocacy groups that specialized in grassroots mobilization and strategic campaigning. The **Indivisible Project**, established in 2016 by Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg—both former congressional aides with deep insights into legislative processes—emerged as a linchpin organizer. Indivisible's model, inspired by Tea Party tactics, focused on building local chapters to pressure elected officials. In the context of 'No Kings,' it coordinated nationwide events, disseminated training materials on effective protesting, and fostered a network of thousands of affiliates across the U.S. Reports highlight its receipt of substantial funding designated for "social welfare activities" and civic engagement initiatives, with some sources pointing to connections with Zionist donors, though these ties are often contextualized within broader philanthropic networks. This funding enabled Indivisible to scale operations, from creating protest toolkits to hosting virtual town halls that engaged millions.

Complementing Indivisible was the **50501 Movement**, credited with originating the "No Kings" moniker, which cleverly alludes to the U.S. Constitution's rejection of hereditary rule. This group emphasized direct action strategies, such as sit-ins and marches, and forged alliances with labor and environmental entities to broaden the movement's base. Its role in the initial April 2025 protests set the tone for subsequent escalations, providing a blueprint for integrating issue-specific advocacy into a unified anti-authoritarian narrative.

**MoveOn**, with its longstanding expertise in online activism dating back to the late 1990s, handled much of the digital mobilization. Known for anti-Trump initiatives since 2016, MoveOn utilized email campaigns, social media amplification, and petition drives to promote events, ensuring high turnout through targeted outreach. Its history of rapid-response petitions allowed for agile adaptation to Trump's policy announcements, turning public sentiment into actionable participation.

### Labor Unions

Labor unions formed a backbone of logistical and manpower support, drawing on their vast memberships to bolster attendance and provide on-the-ground resources. The **Service Employees International Union (SEIU)**, representing approximately 2 million workers in healthcare, public services, and property sectors, was instrumental in mobilizing members for rallies. SEIU's involvement included arranging transportation, supplying materials like signs and water stations, and advocating for workers affected by administration policies. It has benefited from federal grants and infusions from dark-money sources, which critics argue blur the lines between union activities and political campaigning.

The **American Federation of Teachers (AFT)**, under the leadership of Randi Weingarten and encompassing 1.7 million educators, organized teacher contingents that highlighted education-related concerns, such as funding cuts and curriculum controls. AFT's contributions extended to financial support for event infrastructure and advocacy materials, leveraging its influence to integrate protest themes into school discussions and community forums.

**Communications Workers of America (CWA)** focused on media and communication strategies, ensuring widespread coverage and countering negative narratives through press releases and social media management. As part of the larger labor ecosystem, CWA's efforts helped amplify voices from telecommunications and media workers impacted by regulatory changes.

Overarching these was the **American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO)**, an umbrella federation for 12.5 million union members. AFL-CIO provided strategic DNC-linked support, often through channels that some describe as laundered donations, facilitating cross-union collaboration and resource sharing to sustain the movement's longevity.

### Civil Rights and Issue-Based Groups

Civil rights organizations brought expertise in legal advocacy and community organizing, addressing intersections of race, gender, immigration, and more. The **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)** operated as a nonpartisan pillar, offering legal support, litigation preparation, and event facilitation. Regional chapters, including ACLU SoCal and the New York Civil Liberties Union, were particularly active in high-profile locations. A congressional report links the ACLU to $294 million in funding, underscoring its capacity to defend protesters' rights amid potential arrests or suppressions.

The **Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)** rallied socialist-leaning activists, infusing the protests with economic justice demands like wealth redistribution and worker protections, drawing on its growing membership since the Bernie Sanders campaigns.

**Planned Parenthood Federation of America** emphasized reproductive rights, linking Trump's policies to threats against women's health autonomy, and received $294 million in tied funding to bolster its advocacy.

The **Human Rights Campaign (HRC)** advocated for LGBTQ+ issues, highlighting discriminatory policies and mobilizing communities for inclusive participation.

**Public Citizen** pushed for consumer protections and constraints on executive overreach, using research and lobbying to inform protest messaging.

**United We Dream** focused on immigrant rights, organizing Dreamers and undocumented individuals to voice opposition to deportation policies.

The **Working Families Party** served as a progressive political conduit, bridging activism with electoral strategies.

**Black Voters Matter Fund** prioritized voter mobilization in Black communities, countering suppression efforts.

**Color of Change** addressed racial justice, using digital campaigns to highlight systemic inequalities.

The **Sunrise Movement** brought youth-led environmental activism, tying climate concerns to broader democratic threats.

### Other Notable Partners

Beyond these core categories, a array of partners enriched the coalition's diversity. Groups like the **League of Conservation Voters** advocated for environmental policies, while the **Freedom From Religion Foundation** emphasized separation of church and state. The **Party for Socialism and Liberation** added ideological depth, and the **Third Act Movement** engaged older activists. Military veteran-focused **Common Defense**, disability rights advocate **Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN)**, and retiree protector **Social Security Works** each contributed unique perspectives. The **American Federation of Government Employees** represented federal workers directly impacted by shutdowns. Internationally, **Democrats Abroad** and the UK's **Stop Trump Coalition** extended solidarity. Controversial links to **UAW Labor for Palestine** and **NYC Labor for Palestine** have sparked accusations of anti-Israel affiliations from critics.

Funding exposes also mention **Crowds on Demand** for allegedly staffing events, the **Communist Party USA** for ideological support, and environmental giants like **Nature Conservancy** and **World Wildlife Fund**, alongside the **American Red Cross**, though their roles seem peripheral and possibly tied to indirect federal grants. Analyst DataRepublican pinpointed at least 31 NGOs with such connections, characterizing the protests as unprecedented in funding scale for U.S. history.

## Sources of Funding

The financial underpinnings of the 'No Kings' protests blend modest grassroots contributions with hefty infusions from elite donors, creating a multifaceted funding landscape. Estimates peg the total at between $250 million and over $300 million, prompting commentators like Glenn Beck to liken the operation to a "color revolution"—a term for orchestrated regime-change efforts abroad. This section dissects the primary sources, illustrating how funds flow through various channels to sustain the movement's activities.

### George Soros and Open Society Foundations (OSF)

George Soros, via his Open Society Foundations (OSF), stands out as the most frequently referenced benefactor, with a history of supporting progressive causes worldwide. OSF directed $7.61 million in grants specifically to Indivisible for protest-related endeavors, supplemented by additional $7 million and $3 million allocations for broader civic engagement. These funds facilitated everything from organizer salaries to digital advertising campaigns. On a larger scale, OSF's contributions across the coalition totaled $72 million, enabling expansive operations.

OSF's influence extends through affiliates like the **Sixteen Thirty Fund**, a dark-money entity that channels hundreds of millions into initiatives masked as nonpartisan civic work, raising questions about transparency in political funding.

### Other Billionaire Donors and Foundations

A cadre of billionaire philanthropists and their foundations further bolstered the protests. The **Rockefeller Foundation** allocated $28 million to assorted NGOs, supporting efforts in community organizing and policy research that aligned with the movement's goals.

**Arabella Advisors**, a hub for managing progressive dark-money funds, contributed $78 million, facilitating discreet disbursements to avoid direct scrutiny.

**Warren Buffett**'s foundations are associated with $294 million in aggregated support, often through vehicles that fund education and social justice programs intertwined with protest activities.

The **Ford Foundation** provided resources to Indivisible and allied groups, part of a network exceeding $75 million, historically focused on civil rights and democracy-building.

**Tides Foundation**, closely tied to Soros, funneled funds for "astroturfing" tactics, where professional organizing simulates grassroots fervor.

Allegations of indirect involvement from **Bill Gates** via his foundations suggest support for health and equity initiatives that overlap with protest themes.

The **Waltons** (Walmart heirs) linked through family foundations to certain partners, contributing to education and community efforts.

### Federal Grants and Union Dues

Federal grants played a subtle yet significant role, with DataRepublican tracing allocations to 31 nonprofits, including ACLU branches and unions like SEIU and AFT, potentially raising ethical questions about taxpayer money funding political activism.

Union dues generated millions, with AFL-CIO and SEIU directing resources toward direct action support, from strike funds to member education on protest participation.

### Grassroots and Mixed Sources

Despite elite dominance, organizers assert that small donations and volunteerism form the movement's heart, though analyses underscore billionaire influence. Nate Friedman's exposé on NGO interconnections spurred FBI inquiries into financial trails, highlighting tensions between perceived authenticity and structured backing.

## Networks and Controversies

The intricate funding and organizational networks resemble a spiderweb, where OSF grants to Indivisible enable partnerships with federally granted unions like SEIU, all under the No Kings umbrella. This interconnectedness enhances efficiency but fuels accusations of an "insurgency" or "coordinated insurrection." Republican voices, such as Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, reference $294 million in documented receipts from Soros, Buffett, and peers to argue for systemic bias. President Trump's demands for Soros investigations echo broader partisan divides, portraying the protests as externally manipulated.

In defense, organizers maintain that such funding legitimizes advocacy without inciting violence, framing it as essential for countering power imbalances. This dichotomy sparks ongoing debates about protest authenticity in a polarized era.

In conclusion, the 'No Kings' protests, while rallying millions for democratic ideals, owe their magnitude to elite funding streams—Soros at $72 million-plus, Rockefeller at $28 million—routed via Indivisible, ACLU, and others. This reveals a meticulously resourced endeavor, challenging notions of pure organic dissent and igniting discussions on funding's role in modern activism.
