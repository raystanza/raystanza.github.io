## Linux (Compute Foundation)

### Amazon EC2

* **Use-case:** Lift-and-shift or custom AMI deployments
* **Why:** Full control over OS, networking, and installed software
* **Notes:**

  * Autoscale groups for horizontal scaling
  * Use EC2 Auto Recovery and EC2 Image Builder for resilience and patch management
  * Secure via IAM roles, security groups, and Session Manager instead of SSH
* **Learn more:** [EC2 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html) • [EC2 Details](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

* **Use-case:** Managed platform for PHP / Apache workloads
* **Why:** Simplifies deployments (just upload code), handles provisioning, scaling, updates
* **Notes:**

  * Supports rolling deployments and blue/green swaps
  * Provides health dashboards and event logs
* **Learn more:** [Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/index.html) • [Elastic Beanstalk Details](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)

### AWS Fargate & Amazon ECS/EKS

* **Use-case:** Containerized LAMP components
* **Why:** Serverless containers (Fargate) or orchestrated clusters (ECS/EKS)
* **Notes:**

  * Decouple compute from code, faster deployments
  * Integrate with Application Load Balancer and AWS App Mesh

### AWS Lambda

* **Use-case:** Serverless PHP via Lambda Layer (e.g., Bref) or micro-services
* **Why:** No servers to manage, pay per execution
* **Notes:**

  * Combine with API Gateway for REST/HTTP endpoints
  * Cold-start latency considerations for PHP

---

## Apache (Web & Delivery)

### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

* **Use-case:** Distribute HTTP(s) traffic across EC2, containers, or Lambda
* **Why:** Built-in health checks, SSL offload, sticky sessions
* **Learn more:** [ELB Details](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)

### Amazon CloudFront

* **Use-case:** CDN for static assets (CSS, JS, images) and dynamic content caching
* **Why:** Low latency, edge security (WAF integration), custom SSL
* **Learn more:** [CloudFront Details](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)

### Amazon S3 for Static Hosting

* **Use-case:** Host images, media, or even a static single-page front end
* **Why:** 99.99% durability, lifecycle policies, origin for CloudFront
* **Learn more:** [S3 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html)

---

## MySQL (Data Layer)

### Amazon RDS for MySQL

* **Use-case:** Managed MySQL with automated backups, patching, and replicas
* **Why:** High availability via Multi-AZ, automated snapshots, easy scaling
* **Learn more:** [RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds/index.html) • [RDS Details](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)

### Amazon Aurora (MySQL-Compatible)

* **Use-case:** High-performance, serverless, or provisioned cluster
* **Why:** Up to 5× the throughput of standard MySQL, read replicas, Global Database
* **Learn more:** [Aurora Details](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)

### Amazon DynamoDB

* **Use-case:** NoSQL for sessions, user profiles, or metadata
* **Why:** Single-digit millisecond latency, serverless scaling
* **Learn more:** [DynamoDB Details](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

### Amazon ElastiCache

* **Use-case:** In-memory cache with Redis or Memcached
* **Why:** Offload read traffic, accelerate session stores, full-page caching
* **Learn more:** [ElastiCache User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/index.html)

---

## PHP (Application Runtime)

### Running PHP on AWS

* **EC2 / Beanstalk:** Full Apache + PHP-FPM stacks
* **ECS/Fargate:** Dockerized PHP containers
* **Lambda (Bref):** PHP via Lambda layers for event-driven tasks or APIs

### Dependency Management & CI/CD

* **AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild:** Automate build, test, and deploy of Composer projects
* **AWS CodeDeploy:** Blue/green or canary deployments to EC2/ECS/Beanstalk
* **Learn more:** [AWS CodePipeline User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/index.html)

---

## Networking & Security

* **Amazon VPC:** Isolate your resources in private and public subnets
* **Security Groups & NACLs:** Fine-grained network access controls
* **AWS IAM:** Least-privilege roles for EC2, Lambda, RDS, etc. [IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)
* **AWS WAF & Shield:** Protect against common web attacks (SQLi, XSS) and DDoS

---

## Observability & Maintenance

* **Amazon CloudWatch:** Metrics, logs, and alarms for EC2, RDS, Lambda, ELB, and custom PHP logs [CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)
* **AWS X-Ray:** Distributed tracing for PHP applications to pinpoint performance bottlenecks
* **AWS Backup:** Centralized backup for RDS, EFS, DynamoDB, and EC2 volumes [AWS Backup User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/index.html)

---

## Scalability & High Availability

* **Auto Scaling Groups:** Scale EC2 / ECS tasks based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics [Auto Scaling User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/index.html)
* **Aurora Serverless:** Automatically scales the database compute layer
* **Global Accelerator:** Low-latency, regional failover for global audiences

---

## Cost Optimization

* **Reserved & Savings Plans:** Commit to 1–3 years for significant EC2, Lambda, and RDS discounts
* **Spot Instances:** Run non-critical batch jobs or container tasks at up to 90% off
* **S3 Lifecycle:** Move infrequently accessed objects to Glacier Deep Archive

---

## Reference Architectures

1. **Simple Web App:** EC2 + ELB + RDS (MySQL) + CloudFront + S3
2. **Containerized Microservices:** ECS/Fargate + ALB + Aurora Serverless + DynamoDB + X-Ray
3. **Serverless Backend:** API Gateway + Lambda (PHP via Bref) + DynamoDB + CloudFront

For more information check the [AWS Solutions Library](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/).

By mapping each LAMP component to its AWS equivalent-and supplementing with security, scalability, and observability services-you can build a cloud-native architecture that’s more resilient, easier to manage, and ready to grow with your traffic.
