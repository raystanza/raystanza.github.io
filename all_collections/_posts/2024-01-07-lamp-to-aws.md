## Migrating from the LAMP Stack to AWS Services

When replacing a traditional LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack with AWS services, each component of the stack has a corresponding AWS service or feature. Below is a breakdown of each part of the stack and AWS's corresponding service.

## 1. Linux (Operating System)

- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: Provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. [EC2 Details](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: An easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. [Elastic Beanstalk Details](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
- **AWS Fargate**: A serverless compute engine for containers. [Fargate Details](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
- **AWS Lambda**: Lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. [Lambda Details](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

## 2. Apache (Web Server)

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets. [ELB Details](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)
- **Amazon CloudFront**: A fast content delivery network service. [CloudFront Details](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for Apache or NGINX setup.

## 3. MySQL (Database)

- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. [RDS Details](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
- **Amazon Aurora**: Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases. [Aurora Details](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fast and flexible NoSQL database service. [DynamoDB Details](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

## 4. PHP (Programming Language)

### AWS Support

- PHP can be run on various AWS services like EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda

## 5. Conclusion

It is possible to completely replace the LAMP stack with AWS for either speed and stability or cost.  This article is just a brief overview of where to start.
