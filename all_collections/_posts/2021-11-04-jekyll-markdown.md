My kids wanted to randomly generate emoji's and have those descriptions read aloud.

<a href="https://chundersnatch.com/html/clicker.html" target="_blank">ClickeR @ Chundersnatch.com</a>

#### Game Legend:

| icon | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔊 | Choose voice |
| 😃 | Show Emoji 'paragraph' |
| ✏️ | Show text 'paragraph' |

Clicking the "Say This" button will speak the emoji 'paragraph'.

*Be careful as I did not put a "stop talking" function in the code,
the point was to make an annoyance machine via Javascript.*
