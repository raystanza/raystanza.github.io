## Overview

The **Abstract Wallpaper Generator** is a Node.js-based application that generates unique, high-resolution abstract wallpapers. The project features various algorithm-driven abstract patterns such as fractals, waves, and bokeh effects, allowing users to explore and create distinct visual styles. Through simple command-line options or an interactive web interface, users can customize wallpaper dimensions, effects, and output paths to produce the perfect abstract background.

## Features

- **Diverse Generators**: Includes fractals (like Mandelbrot and Julia sets), geometric shapes, and natural textures (like fire and water).
- **Command-Line Control**: Customize wallpaper dimensions and save locations directly from the terminal.
- **Web Interface**: Offers a user-friendly web interface to preview and fine-tune wallpaper effects in real-time.
- **Resolution Flexibility**: Default resolution is set to 1920x1080, but you can adjust this to fit your screen or preferences.

## Available Generators

| Generator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Barnsley Fern** | Creates a fern-like fractal pattern. |
| **Bokeh** | Generates soft, out-of-focus bokeh light effects. |
| **Bubbles** | Produces a bubbly, water-like effect. |
| **Fire** | Simulates a flickering fire texture. |
| **Fractal Tree** | Draws a branching fractal tree. |
| **Ice** | Generates frosty, icy textures. |
| **Julia Set** | Produces intricate fractal patterns using the Julia set. |
| **Koch Snowflake** | Draws a fractal Koch snowflake. |
| **Mandelbrot Set** | Renders the classic Mandelbrot fractal. |
| **Sierpinski Triangle** | Creates a fractal Sierpinski triangle. |
| **Snow** | Simulates snowfall. |
| **Water** | Renders flowing water-like ripples. |
| **Waves** | Draws sinusoidal wave patterns. |

Each generator offers its own unique style, and you can experiment with them to discover new abstract visuals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **How can I add my own generator?**
  - Add a new file to `src/generators/` with your custom drawing logic. Then, import it in `generateWallpaper.js` to make it accessible.

- **Can I use different colors for the designs?**
  - Yes! The `utils.js` file includes helper functions for colors. You can modify these to customize your palette.

- **Is it possible to create custom resolutions?**
  - Absolutely. Use the `--width` and `--height` options in the terminal or select a resolution in the web interface.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add user-defined color palettes for each generator
- [ ] Enable randomization modes for pattern variations
- [ ] Provide downloadable wallpaper packs
- [x] Include interactive preview in web interface (completed 2024-11-10)
