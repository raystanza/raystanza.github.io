**ognp** (OG Notepad) preserves the simple, no-nonsense editing experience of classic Windows Notepad.  
It’s a **portable** WinForms app built on **.NET 9**, with **no telemetry**, **no network calls**, and **no external NuGet packages**. The goal is fidelity: file menu behaviors, Word Wrap quirks, encoding/EOL handling, and printing that feel exactly right.

## Why this project?

Modern Notepad has evolved, but some of us miss the ultra-minimal tool that opens fast, stays out of the way, and saves exactly what we typed. **ognp** exists to be that dependable classic—nothing more, nothing less.

---

## Features

- **Classic UI & behavior**
  - File: New / Open / Save / Save As… / Page Setup / Print / Print Preview / Exit  
  - Edit: Undo, Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete, **Find**, **Find Next (F3)**, **Replace**, **Go To (Ctrl+G)**, **Time/Date (F5)**, Select All  
  - Format: **Word Wrap** (off by default), **Font…**  
  - View: **Status Bar** (hidden when Word Wrap is ON — classic behavior)
- **Encodings & line endings**
  - BOM detection for UTF-8/16/32; otherwise defaults to **ANSI** (system code page)
  - “Save As” lets you choose: ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-8 (BOM), UTF-16 LE/BE, UTF-32 LE/BE
  - Detects & preserves **CRLF / LF / CR** on save; Status Bar shows both EOL and encoding
- **Quality-of-life**
  - Drag & drop to open
  - Accurate caret position and selection length in the Status Bar
- **No bloat**
  - No telemetry, no network, **no external packages**
  - Single portable `.exe`—no installer required

> **Non-goal:** ognp is not a code editor (no tabs, no syntax highlighting, no plugins).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| New / Open / Save / Save As | `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+O` / `Ctrl+S` / `F12` |
| Find / Find Next / Replace | `Ctrl+F` / `F3` / `Ctrl+H` |
| Go To / Select All / Time/Date | `Ctrl+G` / `Ctrl+A` / `F5` |

*When **Word Wrap** is ON, **Go To** is disabled and the **Status Bar** is hidden—just like classic Notepad.*
