**Styrup** is a custom KDE Plasma 6 splash screen that fuses vintage design language with the modern desktop experience.
Drawing on the *Jazz Cup* patterns of the late 1990s, it features fluid neon shapes, subtle gradients, and a looping animated logo that welcomes you into the desktop with flair.

## Highlights

* **Retro-inspired design** – Captures the nostalgic look of 1990s interfaces while maintaining KDE’s visual clarity.
* **Smooth animation** – Fully optimized for Plasma 6’s QML compositor and GPU acceleration.
* **Open-source and modular** – Simple directory layout makes remixing colors, timing, and logos effortless.
* **KDE-native packaging** – Works as a `.tar.gz` Plasma Splash theme; install directly via *System Settings → Startup and Shutdown → Splash Screen*.
* **Lightweight footprint** – Minimal resource impact, running seamlessly even on integrated GPUs.

## Inspiration

Styrup is an homage to early digital aesthetics-CRT glow, pastel gradients, and geometric motion design.
The name itself hints at *“booting up”* with style, a nod to the days when every operating system greeted users with flair.
