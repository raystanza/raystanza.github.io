Welcome to **{{ site.title }}**, where I showcase various projects, thoughts, and acts of futility. Here youâ€™ll find my latest posts and updates on technology, coding, and creativity.

<div id="greeting" style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;"></div>

<script>
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const greetingElement = document.getElementById('greeting');
  
  if (hour >= 6 && hour < 12) {
    greetingElement.textContent = "ðŸŒž Good morning, visitor! Dive into some content to start your day!";
  } else if (hour >= 12 && hour < 18) {
    greetingElement.textContent = "ðŸŒž Good afternoon! Hereâ€™s something interesting for your afternoon.";
  } else {
    greetingElement.textContent = "ðŸŒœ Good evening! Wind down with some late-night reading.";
  }
</script>
