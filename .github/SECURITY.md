## Security Policy

RayStanza.uk is a personal blog and portfolio, and I prioritize the security and privacy of all visitors. While the site is primarily informational, I am committed to addressing any potential security vulnerabilities that may arise.

## Supported Versions

Since this is a static Jekyll site hosted on GitHub Pages, the site does not process or store user data, and there are no back-end services or authentication mechanisms. However, I still encourage reporting any potential issues that may affect the safety or integrity of the site.
